UnityDebugger
=============

Unity Debug wrapper, with few useful methods and debugBuild checking.

If included into Unity project as a .dll library, double-click in the console will lead directly to debug line, not into code of library. 
I'm using it in my personal work, so why not to allow other use it too?

I will update this project when I'll find some spare time.
